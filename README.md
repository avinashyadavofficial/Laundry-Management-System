# Laundry Management System

This is a simple Laundry Counter application built using Python's Tkinter library. It allows users to track and manage counts of different types of clothes for laundry purposes.

## Features

- **Reset Counts:** Reset all counts to zero with the "Reset counts" button.
- **View Total:** Check the total count of all clothing items by clicking the "Submit" button.
